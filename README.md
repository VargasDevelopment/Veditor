# Veditor
A pure python text editor I'm making in Python with Tkinter. It supports some python syntax highlighting and auto-indentation for python syntax.

## To run
Clone the repository into a directory of your choice and run Veditor.py. Since this project is pure python, there are no dependencies.

## Requirements
Python 3.X
